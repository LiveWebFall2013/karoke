// RECORDING FILES FOR LIVE WEB KARAOKE //

The index.html file contains all necessary elements to be merged with the other files. 
The most important elements are for the HTML team: 
- 2 buttons for [STOP RECORDING] and [START RECORDING]
- Listing of finished recordings [RECORDINGSLIST] and the according download links

IMPORTANT: do not alter recorder.js AND recorderWorker.js

recorder.js and recorderWorker.js need to be in the same folder as the index.html file to ensure this feature will work.
